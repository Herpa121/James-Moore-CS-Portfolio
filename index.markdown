# Welcome to My Professional Portfolio

Hi, I’m James Moore, and this is my portfolio. Begin with reading my Professional Self Assessment from my time at SNHU and see my artifacts listed at the bottom.

## Professional Self-Assessment
My experience and completion of the Computer Science program at SNHU has allowed me to solidify my strengths, focus on professional goals, and improve my employability in the tech industry. Key skills I’ve developed in becoming a competent software developer and effective team player converge in algorithms, software engineering, database, security, and team & stakeholder communications as core attributes of this ePortfolio demonstration. 

## Team Collaboration and Stakeholder Communication
Throughout the program, I had opportunities to work in team environments. Collaboration with peers has marked my ability to disassemble complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks, and enforce alignment with team members towards common goals. Adherence to Agile workflows & team meetings, version control via Git, and code reviews have become a staple to developing my expectations of effective communication and ensuring timely project delivery within the software development lifecycle.

Communicating with stakeholders has also been integral to understanding how to translate complex technical jargon and decisions into effective business values, allowing clear communication between technical and non-technical audiences.


## Software Engineering & Design
One of my greatest strengths gained from my experience at SNHU is the development of software design principles for ensuring scalable and maintainable software development. My coursework emphasizes the importance of clean, modular design, with adherence to proper standards such as SOLID principles that ensure extensible and adaptable codebases and design for flexibility with future updates in accordance with the software development lifecycle. 

In addition to design principles, strong architectural decisions that accommodate evolving user requirements without compromising performance or technical functionality became a skill I heavily value. This focus on both immediate and future design competency and workflow has bolstered my valuing of adhering to proper best practices and reducing friction in collaborative environments. 

## Data Structures and Algorithms
My coursework has helped establish problem solving skills and evaluation of algorithmic solutions for real-world problems while accounting for security concerns. Incorporation of efficient algorithms and robust data structures remains a core staple in my knowledge of developing scalable and secure data-driven applications – ranging from developing modular services from scratch with well-rounded security coverage to reinforcing existing programs based on underlying infrastructure and recognizing implicit vulnerabilities.

Outside the scope of security, my ability to critically evaluate trade-offs in algorithm and data structure design has allowed me to make proper decisions for reliable and efficient developments of code and design. Recognizing computational complexity of algorithms by balancing factors like space and time complexity to achieve optimal solutions for dealing with both high and low-volume data processing is not outside my expertise. 

## Security
I’ve grown keen on a security-first mindset, anticipating potential vulnerabilities across various layers through Defense in Depth (DiD) among software. Whether it’s scanning for vulnerabilities within code libraries to secure encapsulation of code, ensuring secure applications from multiple angles and entry points remains a core habit. Not only recognizing vulnerabilities but providing clear documentation and solutions among teams proves to be of great value.

## Database
I’ve been exposed to several different implementations of database integration ranging from Python to Java under different contexts. I’ve tackled programs with interactive graphs through paginated lists to security-driven services that bolster security through prepared statements, automatic resource closing, and encrypting sensitive user information. My knowledge of properly encapsulating database security within code has become a core part of my recent development in database integration as I continue to develop usage of industry standard best practices.
